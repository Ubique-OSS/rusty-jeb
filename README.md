# JEB API Rust wrappers
This repository uses the jni-rs crate and the Java inovation API to create a JVM and let the JEB-Api run in it. It is not a complete wrapper (yet) but functionality was and is added on demand. Any pull requests are welcome :) 

The examples folder contains an example on how to use the debugger.
